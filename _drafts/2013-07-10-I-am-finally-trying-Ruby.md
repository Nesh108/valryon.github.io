The title is pretty clear but I never thought I would do it. 
Here is my first experiences with this completely different environement.

## From ASP.NET MVC

It's been a while since I've using *.NET* for my projects. 

I made several projects using *ASP.NET MVC*, especially a big secured webservice handling thousands of requests each day, and I must admit that this framework is awesome.

But for [Pixelnest](http://pixelnest.io), I'm not sure this is a good choice. It's a bit hard to deploy this kind of app on an Apache server, even if I'm managed to I'm not sure this is reliable, and Windows Server licence are too expensive for us at the moment.

So having a look at modern web technologies, *Ruby* and *Ruby on Rails* seems to be a good choice and it was a good timing for me to learn new things.

## Ruby is different

Sounds obvious but you must relearn many things. Accessors are weird, inheritance is complex (*inherits*?*extends*?*<*?), *symbols* are new for Java/.NET devsâ€¦

And of course the syntax, the "Duck Typing" philosophy, everyting is a bit uncommon to me.

## Starting a little webservice

What I did in .NET and wanted to do in Ruby is a simple webservice that can fetch a database and respond to few REST http requests.

The webservice must have encrypted JSON input / output.

The database doesn't matter, it is just to store some game stats and some resources (config, lists).

Quite simple, right?

### Getting on the Rails

Without knowing anything in Ruby I started a Rails project. I quickly realized that this is an advanced subject and that it would be too hard to learn *Ruby*, *Rails*, *Rake* and all other cool frameworks all in once.

### Trying Sinatra

### The results

## Deployment

This was one of our main concerns with ASP.NET MVC, and with Heroku and other cool hosting platforms we thought Ruby was the right choice for us.

So, was it?

## Will I use Ruby in the future ?

## Some newbie resources

There is so much written for Ruby that you can easily be lost as a newbie.

Here are some lectures I recommend even if it is probably not the best. It helps me a lot, thanks to their authors!
