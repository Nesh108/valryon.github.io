Since September 2016 I am now teaching `C# Programming` in `Unity3D` for [Laval "3di" Licence's degree](http://www.laval3di.org/).

Most students has never used Unity3D neither wrote a single line of code so this is an interesting challenge and I am doing my best to share my knowledge with them.

Courses are mostly about realizing very small games: a small 2D shoot'em up, a "roll-a-ball" 3D game, etc. Learning by practicing.
