title: Pitch My Game Breizh Edition
---

[Pitch My Game](http://pitchmygame.com/) is a serie of french events allowing game developers to *pitch* a game project to a diverse audience (pro, players, press).

I helped organizing two instances:

- One during the Stunfest 2014 (Le Liberté, Rennes). (~300 people, main stage).
- The Breizh #1 PMG edition (La Cantine Numérique, Rennes). ~100 people.
