I was invited by the [Médiathèque Gao-Xingjian](http://www.la-bibliotheque.com/evenements/conference-3/#section_contenu) to talk about the video game development process, the jobs involved and how we achieved to create Steredenn. The conference was aimed for an inexperienced audience. ~50 people present.
