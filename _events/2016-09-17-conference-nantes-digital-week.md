shortdesc: Talk - my video game creation process
---

I was invited by the [Médiathèque Gao-Xingjian](http://www.la-bibliotheque.com/evenements/conference-3/#section_contenu) to talk about the video game development process, the jobs involved and how we achieved to create **Steredenn**. 

The conference was aimed for an inexperienced audience. ~50 people was there.
