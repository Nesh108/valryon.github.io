I'm a 25 years old developer, living in Rennes, France.

I'm a computer and video games freak since childhood. I played a lot of games, but my love will always be to some memorable titles.

*The Lost Vikings, Medievil, Crash Bandicoot, Warcraft 3, Zelda: Link's Awakening, Phantasy Star Online, Metal Slug, Itadaki Street, Kirby's Dreamland 2... I could be doing this list forever*.

I am mostly skilled in .NET and Java technologies but I am curious and I love to learn new things. I think I should try Ruby.

Since 2013 I am creating my company [Pixelnest Studio](http://pixelnest.io) with [Matthieu Oger](http://solarsailer.net). We want to create awesome products (apps, games, stuff).

## My main projects

Here's the list of the projects I spent some (a lot?) of time on.
