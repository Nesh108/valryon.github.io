title: About me!

Hello curious folk,

I am a **software and video game developper** working at <a class="pixelnest-logo" href="http://pixelnest.io">Pixelnest Studio</a>, a company I created in 2013 with my friend [Matthieu Oger](https://matthieuoger.com/). We are creating games and apps we are proud of, like [Steredenn](http://steredenn.pixelnest.io).

I'm a computer and video games freak since childhood. I played a lot of games, but my love will always be to some memorable titles.

```
The Lost Vikings, Medievil, Crash Bandicoot, Warcraft 3, Zelda: Link's Awakening, Phantasy Star Online, Metal Slug, Itadaki Street, Kirby's Dreamland 2, Towerfall, Team Fortress 2, Dota, Spelunky, FTL, Perfect Dark, Worms Armageddon, Half-Life, Starfox...
```

I could be doing this list forever, and I would need to keep it updated every month.

I am skilled in **.NET** (I love C#) and I am experienced with a lot of Microsoft stuff (ASP.NET MVC, XNA, WPF, SqlServer...). I also worked a lot with Unity3D. With Pixelnest we took the time to learn new technologies and I now love to use **ruby** for small scripts and **Go** for software and web servers.
