title: Unity and me

I made quite a lot of stuff using XNA and Monogame. But with the recent [Unity 2D tools announcement](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2013/08/28/unity-native-2d-tools/), and with the fact that the whole part of the industry is migrating to the tool, I think it really was time to learn how to create a game with Unity.

I already tried 5 or 6 times to use it in the past, each time giving up and coming back to XNA. This time I'm trying again, and I'm convinced.

What I really like:

- The real-time editor
- You focus on the scene, not the engine
- On a good screen, the editor is not that bad
- Plugins, code examples, community

Working on a new prototype, I made a simple test. A first basis in XNA using all my code and knowledge and the same thing in Unity.

The result: 3 days in XNA, 6 hours in Unity (with 3d as a bonus).

It's quite fun to watch in action so I am doing Gifs of my work everyday. Here's the last one, with triggers and traps killing things :

By the way, I found some good links I'd like to share:

- [Building Levels In Unity](http://www.paladinstudios.com/2013/07/05/building-levels-in-unity-part-1-of-3/)
- [Make a 2D game using free tools](http://www.rocket5studios.com/tutorials/make-a-2d-game-in-unity3d-using-only-free-tools-part-1/) and especially the [pathfinding part](http://www.rocket5studios.com/tutorials/make-a-2d-game-with-unity3d-using-only-free-tools-beginning-enemy-ai-with-a-pathfinding/)
- [Runner: a minimal side-scroller](http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/runner/)

If you are into game dev, you should give Unity a try. It suits most indies needs, but it's also true that you won't feel the same pleasure creating and tweaking your own game engine.
