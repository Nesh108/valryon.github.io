Advanced Timer usable as a coroutine for Unity.

<!--more-->

Here is a simple and powerful **Timer class**.

Features:

- A duration (it will wait n seconds then execute the piece of code)
- Repeat this timer until the object is destroyed or stopped
- The callback, a ``System.Action`` delegate to execute some code with a very simple syntax

Enjoy :).
