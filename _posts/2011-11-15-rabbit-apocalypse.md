**Rabbit Apocalypse!** is a short and simple **2D platformer** with random level creation.

The earth is going to be blown by an asteroid, and rabbits want to survive by going into space with their spaceship.
Sdaly they lost the key, and you must find it quickly!

The level generation consists in assembling already defined pieces toegether randomly following rules.

The little game was made in two months from scratch for a contest (Game A Niaque 2011). It uses a custom XNA engine full of bugs.
