title: My first week as an indie

As announced [a week ago](http://www.dmayance.com/2013-02-19-new-life-new-blog), I am now a full time **indie developer**.

For now it's non-official (I'm just unemployed) but in two months I will start a company with Matthieu Oger. We plan to make cool **games** and **apps**, **mobile**, **web** or **desktop**. Basicaly the only limits we have is that we don't have much money and we are only two. And I think we won't do porn.

But for now Matthieu is not available and I'm on my own. Let me share my first thoughts.

# Freedom

Having no pressure (for now) and already launched projects to work on makes me quite **free**. I work when I want and how I want.

This have a some counterparts: 

- I must **resists not to play games** all day long (Mass Effect 3 is awesome. Dota 2 is really time-consuming)

- I must **focus on few projects**, especially the one where I am not alone. For now I want to work on 2 games : one mobile, one Leap motion. But actualy all my time is for the mobile project.

- I must **find something else to do**. I want to avoid working during Week-ends (Sundays at least) but the temptation is huge.

- I try not to work after 5:30 p.m, because that was what I really hated when I was in companies.

This seems obvious but being its own boss won't work for every one. I am still not very productive, I'd say 50% to what I can do.

# Tools & Workflow

I am trying to get a nice asynchronous workflow for my projects.

As tools, I use :

- [Github](https://github.com/Valryon) for source code
- Trello for great todo-lists 
- Gmail and Gtalk for team chat and reports
- Google Drive for document edition
- Dropbox for file storing

What bothers me a bit is the duplicate usage between dropbox and google drive. 

And my dev env is:

- A windows machine 
	- Windows 8
	- Visual Studio 2010 & 2012 express
	- GitHub for Windows
	- Dropbox
	- Chrome

- A Macbook Pro
	- XCode
	- GitHub for Mac
	- Dropbox
	- Chrome

Both dropbox & chrome synchronized. Light, portable, nothing too expansive (even if I wish I could afford a Visual Studio Pro license), easy to (re)install, nothing stored locally (Internet is now vital).


I will try to keep updating on my situtation. You can also read me on [Twitter (@Valryon)](http://twitter.com/Valryon).
