A Unity prototype of a local multiplayer platformer fight. Mainly inspired by [Jump Bump](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAjbKy7ChwY).

Made quite quickly, about 1.5 days of full work.

You will need the Unity player to try it. As it is just a rough draft I'm not going to controls or anything.

**Assets:** Rabbit Apocalypse!, made by Thibault Person ([mrlapinou](http://twitter.com/mrlapinou)).

Still work in progress.
