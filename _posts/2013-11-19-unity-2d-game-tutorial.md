A quick but interesting news:

We just released for Pixelnest a complete tutorial about [how to use Unity to make a 2d game](http://pixelnest.io/tutorials/2d-game-unity/).

We make a Shoot'em up that looks a lot like _The Great Paper Adventure_, and we cover a large bunch of topics: installation, gameplay, special effects and even deployement on iOS. 

Enjoy ;).
