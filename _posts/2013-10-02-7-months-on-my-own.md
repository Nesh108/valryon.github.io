title: Nearly 7 months on my own

I left my web developer job at RegionsJob in February 2013, nearly 7 months ago, to make my own company.

Here we are, 7 months later. The company is not created yet, but it is planned for January 2014. Projects we were planning have been delayed then canceled. A tough but right decision. [We are explaining those things in our first company's blog post](http://pixelnest.io/2013/09/breaking-news/).

You may ask what I have been doing during all this time, so here is a summary of my activity.

# 7 months at home

First, a quick feeling about my indie life. Last august I moved back in Brest. I still like working from home, even if it is lonely some days. I missed the video game contacts I had in Rennes. But it's not that far, it's just I can feel stuck at home some days.

I'm still trying to find my rhythm, it's hard to establish a healthy routine. I need to separate more my work from my hobbies, which are the same right now (video games!).

Having time for everything is great. I need to improve my work time but this is connected to projects I think.

The hardest part is that we didn't ship anything yet, so for most people we are either on vacation or doing nothing. We took vacation (summer was terrible for work) but we also made a lot of progress and prototypes to find the right idea.

# 7 months of projects

We have tons of ideas, I am quite a fast coder, so there are plenty of pieces of games to show.

## The Koikoukesse

The canceled (for now) video game quiz for iOS.
 
[  ![Koikoukesse sketches][url_img_koikou]  ][url_img_koikou]

- I made an _ASP.NET MVC_ secured back-end
- I learned _Ruby_ and rewrite the back-end so we can host it on _Heroku_ for free
- I made the game basis (questions, win/lose, score, screens with placeholders)

## Pixpuzzle

A clone of _PathPix_ games, for the challenge.

[  ![Pix puzzle iOS][url_img_pixpuzzle]  ][url_img_pixpuzzle]

- Fully working, despite its lack of optimization and design
- Cross-platform: iOS and Windows Phone (using Xamarin)

## Pon

A clone of _Panel de Pon_. Here again, for challenge.

- Cross-platform: Windows, Mac and iOS (Xamarin again)
- Solo mode is working
- Realtime multiplayer with Game Center on iOS. A disaster but worth the test)

## Georges

- The game we had with Pixelnest for the Stunfest 2013.
- I wrote the code while Matthieu was working on the Koikou, [Marion Chr√©tien](http://www.xn--miroir-enchant-okb.com/) draw some nice graphics for us. 

[  ![George with XNA][url_img_george_xna]  ][url_img_george_xna]

- Rewrote partially with _Unity_, our new main tech.
- We tried a 3D effect and realtime terraformation (I like the result, even if it's not perfect)

## Unnamed weird company simulator

A real _Unity_ test:

- 3D (no modeling but the screenshot speaks for itself)
- Pathfinding


## Bunny splash

The last prototype. I already wrote a blog post about it. We are trying some local multiplayer concept (= 4 players on the same screens having fun).

- First mode, a _Jump'n'Bump_ remix.

[  ![Bunny Splash][url_img_bunny_splash]  ][url_img_bunny_splash]

- An _Hidden in Plain sight_ test mode (working but design is horrible).

[  ![Bunny Hunt][url_img_bunny_hunt]  ][url_img_bunny_hunt]

- We are experimenting a new mode with castles.

# Next 7 months

Those bunch of prototypes are just a start. You will hear from us soon, especially when _Unity_ will release it's 2D tools. We have plans for _George_, _The Great Paper Adventure_ and new fresh ideas!

Stay tuned!
