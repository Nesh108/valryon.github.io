Fellows devs and players, if you come in France this week-end and more precisely in Rennes, come see me and Matthieu at the **[Stunfest 2013](http://www.stunfest.fr/)**!

We will be there on two booths presenting our current projects. Both of them will be fully **playable**.

And both of them have only codenames for now.

# Koikoukesse

Test your video game knowledge in this **fun and simple video game quizz**, in solo and multiplayer game modes!

Soon available for iOS devices.

This game is made in full collaboration with Laurent Brossard, an awesome game designer.

Playable on iPad this week-end.

# George

George is a friendly pirate that want to be rich and conquer the world, like we all do.

Help him try to achieve his goal: **choose an island, dig for treasures, and bring the gold back home!**

But be careful, the other pirates want this gold too, they will try to take it back from you. Use your shotgun, canons and whatever you find to defend yourself on the way back.

One day available for PC (with Leapmotion compatibility), and iOS devices.

The graphics are made by Marion Ch√©rtien, an awesome graphist.

# Thanks, thanks and thanks

A big thanks to **3hitcombo** and the **West Indie Collective** that provide us a booth during this awesome festival.

You will find many games to play there, from retrogaming to other indies titles.

I will link to the official WIC Stunfest page when it will be done ;).
