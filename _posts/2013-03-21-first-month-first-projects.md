I can also reveal that I will create **Pixelnest Studio** in May with Matthieu Oger. It will be a little development studio creating games and apps on mobile, web and desktop support (so nearly everywhere). We will start based at Rennes, France.

We have **two games projects** in our boxes. We’d like to sell them both quickly as soon as we really create the company, so it could maybe makes some income. 

Those projects keep me busy and motivated. But I found my **nemesis**: Dota 2. I can’t stop playing that game, it is just too addictive. I still manage to work on the projects, but I think I am at ~4 games of 45 minutes each per day. I plan to fight it: sport (I’m discovering [Endomondo]( http://www.endomondo.com/) for running), music ([Rocksmith]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTFU2LGKEqk)!) and finishing all finishables games I bought, like the Xbox 360 Castlevania.

So what I am working on.

## A video game quiz

This game is an origina lcreation from [Laurent Brossard](http://rednalhgih.com/), who was looking for developers for a mobile version.

We are creating an iOS (for now) version of the [KoiKouKesse](http://koikoukesse.fr.st/). It is a fast and simple quiz game. We are adding a multiplayer versus mode and some cool stuff.

We are using [Monotouch](http://xamarin.com/monotouch) and, for a .NET developer, it’s **awesome**. It’s cheap, reliable, the IDE is nice (and relay on official tools like Interface Builder or the simulator). Even connecting to Game Center is easy.

## A leap motion game

As Matthieu and me are both [Leapmotion](http://leapmotion.com) devs, we are creating a funny 2D game with it.

It looks like that:

But every day I add some cool features, so actually there is sharks who want to eat drowing pirates and you must saves them to win bonuses. [Like in this secret cheated video you shouldn’t see]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A11Z3wvrprk).

What you see is not what you will get, [Marion Chrétien](http://www.xn--miroir-enchant-okb.com/) is working on new awesome sprites but I am using a lot of placeholders for now!

Working on this game doesn’t actually look like **working**. At least when you implements an orbital laser and you think "nah, it’s not pirate enough".
 
[Ridiculous Fishing](http://www.ridiculousfishing.com/) has shown everyone that paid games still sold well if they are good. And fun, **really really fun**. We do not pretend we can make something as good as this one, but it is a nice source of inspiration.

We are using the Leapmotion SDK (what a surprise) and [MonoGame]( www.monogame.net). MonoGame is nice, and will be great soon. 
This game is at first targeted for the Leapmotion store, then we may port it on tablets.

## Want to try them?

Both of those games will be playable at [Stunfest]( http://www.stunfest.fr/) 2013, thanks to **3hitcombo** and the **West Indie Collective**! Come and try them, if you like video games (retro, arcade, new, tournaments, concerts, conferences, …) you have to see this event.
