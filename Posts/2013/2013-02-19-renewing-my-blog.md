Starting from the day after tomorrow I'll truly be an **indie software and game developer**.

By truly I mean that I just left my current job at [RegionsJob](http://www.regionsjob.com), an awesome French website making company, to create my own business with a friend, **[Matthieu Oger](http://www.twitter.com/yiashen)**.

We are currently working on the company creation and on several game projects to start. I will come back on them later.

For now I just renew entirely my blog. What was before a simple Wordpress site is now a homemade blog engine, because it’s fun to reinvent the wheel sometimes.

So this is an ASP.NET MVC website running on a Linux server and parsing Markdown articles.

The whole code source and the articles are open-source. I can simply publish new content by pushing it on my Gitub repository, and a git hook will update the server remotely.

## Breaking changes

The major change is that I will now be writing in English, even if I’m French. It was hard to decide, but I have chosen the language that can bring me more opportunities (tweeting in English already gave me a lot of them).

I hope I’m not making too much mistakes and that my writing will get better with practice.

I also decided to **trash some old content**. I kept some (see stared items), but a lot of useless things is now gone. Thoses articles are still in French and I don't plan to translate them. You will see a little warning on top of them.

Only the XNA french tutorial may be cleaned and updated if I find some time for it.

## Expect to come
-	Some LeapMotion demo I’m working on
-	Company presentation
-	Technical on opinion posts

*Stay tuned!*
