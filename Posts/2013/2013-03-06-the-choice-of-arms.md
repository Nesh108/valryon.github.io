I am on the beginning of my first new project as an indie.

This is **exciting and really challenging**. I feel like I must climb a giant moutain (the targeted product is no that simple) on my own, it's scary.

But little by little, I cut this huge project in small pieces and build it slowly.

For each piece (server, client, UI, database, etc) I must decide how to do it. There's no company history, no reusable code base, everything get started from scratch.

And I must choose the *right* tech or framework.

Making a little game, I first looked at Monogame combined with MonoTouch to support it. After few days of failure, I decided to move on: I couldn't do it with that, mostly because I didn't know of it works.

Then I tried a native iOS solution. I have a Java and mainly .NET developper background and I quickly learned Objective-C recently. My little prototype was a failure too, with too many caveats due to my lack of experience.

Finally I tried MonoTouch only and it was great. In one day I achieved a lot of work, took a lot of pleasure and had a pleasant result.

This was the *right* solution: fits my **needs**, my **skills** and **pleased** me. I can work well and quick. You will probably tell me that I'd rather use another solution, because we all redefine what is right for us.

The harder part is to think what you need **now** and not what you need when you have 1M users. If you reach this level of popularity, you'll have time and money to spent on scalability and product redesign.

I **love** this freedom in the choice of arms. I just try to keep focused on the product to avoid the trap of the perpual prototyping step, changing the tech everyday.
