A few hours ago, Microsoft officialy announced to their XNA MVP that they will not support the framework anymore ([Source and interesting comments on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/17mqy6/directxxna_phase_out_continues/)).

This wasn’t really a surprise : XNA is not available with Visual Studio 2012, and it’s not officially compatible with Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8.

So even if everyone knew it, what does it means for the community of XNA developers?

Does it makes all my tutorials obsolete? Is your game doomed to extinction?

**Spoiler:** of course not.

## R.I.P, XNA

As many developers, I always wanted to make video games. But making a game in a low-language like C++ with a low-level framework like SDL is not easy at all, you have to know how to do everything : display images, play sounds, load models, implement game logic…

Of course some engines and framework simplify all of this but, when XNA started back in 2006, it was a real progress : the first managed and well crafted game making framework.

And it has some real arguments to convince developers  The content pipeline allowed you to load every type of assets in one line, the integration with Visual Studio was great, the deployment on Xbox 360 and later on Windows Phone 7 was a nice feature.

If you want to know the feedback of the community, follows the hashtag **[#becauseofXNA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23becauseofxna&src=hash)**.

So instead of XNA, but still in C# and still an easy way to make games, what can we use?

## XNA is dead, long live MonoGame!

We XNA devs are lucky. A great team ported the framework in a new multiplateform and open-source one. You have nearly the same features, the same namespaces, and you can target all systems (even mobile ones). What you mostly have to do is to change the dll reference in your project properties, and that’s all.

It’s time to discover **[MonoGame](http://monogame.codeplex.com/)** ! Using the 3.0 installer, it’s really easy to replace your old XNA installation with a fresh new one of MonoGame.

There’s still some work in progress : content pipeline, documentation… and some features will be lost forever : XACT for example.

But when you see that Bastion, or Skulls of the Shogun, an official Microsoft Studios Game !, use MonoGame, you should give it a try.

**Bonus:** the team behind is awesome and reactive.

## Unity

If you want to see some fresh air, you should definitely [look at **Unity**](http://unity3d.com/).

It’s an incredible SDK to make complex games on all platforms.

The counterpart is that, in my opinion, you have less controls on the code and you have to adapt to the tool’s logic.

But this is the main tools for many indie developers, and it use also C# if you want, so you should definitely learn it, especially if you do not really enjoy engine programming.

## Future of XBLIG?

Something I still want to know is about the future of the Xbox Live Indie Game. Many XNA dev has released one or more titles on the market. I think no-one but Minecraft clone makers has really been making billions of dollars but it was a great experience.

Microsoft never did anything good with this market. But we all like to know what will happen with our game: will they stay on the market forever? Will they be retired from sales?

I hope that [The Great Paper Adventure](http://marketplace.xbox.com/fr-FR/Product/The-Great-Paper-Adventure/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80258550897?cid=search) will survive for some times and on some Xbox (and maybe some memories?). Anyway I also have a PC version, thanks to the compatibility.

## What do we do now

The same thing as before: **GAMES!**

You can do while keeping your XNA Monogamed projects, and that’s cool.

Or you can try Unity.

Or you can try a hundred of other cool frameworks, depending of the platform you are targeting : LÖVE (Lua), Corona (Obj-C + Lua), Unity…

**We are in a great time to make games and it’s not a surprise so many people go indie (including me!).**
