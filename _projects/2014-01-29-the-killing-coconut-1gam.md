---

I participated to the [2014 "One Game a Month" challenge](http://onegameamonth.com) to enhance my game design and game developer skills.

For January, the theme was **Respawn**.

Here's my production. It's still rough, graphics are ripped from a pack and an older project, there is no end... but it's kinda fun!

It has been made in 2 full days.

It was made with Unity3D using all the new [2D features](http://pixelnest.io/tutorials/2d-game-unity/).

# The game

## Play!

**[Click on any image to play (Unity3D).][game_link]**

## Gameplay

The idea comes from a citation:

````
"Falling Coconuts Kill More People Than Shark Attacks"
George Burgess
````

An evil coconut has decided to eradicate humans from the earth by killing them one by one.

It's you! And you have 60 sec to kill as many things as possible!

## Controls

* SPACEBAR to fall
* SPACEBAR to use **slow-motion**
* ARROWS to move the coconut!

# Credits

* Graphics ripped from [George](http://pixelnest.io/work/george)
* Additionnal graphics from Kenney Platform Pack.
* Music by Isak Martinsson
